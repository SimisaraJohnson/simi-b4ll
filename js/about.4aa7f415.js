The main advantage of using biometrics in low tech environments comes from the need to reach a larger audience of users. This benefit is even more evident in places where the number of national ID holders is reduced. Thus, in some developing countries, starting from a scenario where access to national ID is difficult, the registration and authentication of users on mobile operators may be compromised. In this sense, the use of biometrics allows the use of non-transferable information, leading to greater adherence by users. This makes biometrics the ideal and more accurate solution for validating personal data.
